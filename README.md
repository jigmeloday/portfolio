### PORTFOLIO

Hello everyone! Welcome to my portfolio, which I have built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I've incorporated animation effects powered by Framer Motion to enhance the overall experience. If you're interested in using this portfolio, feel free to fork the repository and customize it according to your preferences.

How to use?
To get started, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
shell
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Install the dependencies:
shell
Copy code
yarn install
Start the development server:
shell
Copy code
yarn dev
Once you've executed these commands, the development server will be up and running, allowing you to preview your portfolio locally.

I have also set up GitHub Actions and Husky to improve code quality. GitHub Actions automates workflows, while Husky manages Git hooks to enforce coding standards. These configurations ensure a smoother development process and enhanced code reliability.

For more details, please refer to the package.json file in the repository.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Happy coding! ðŸ˜„
